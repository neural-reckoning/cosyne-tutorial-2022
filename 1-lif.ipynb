    "## The mathematics of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The neuron model is as follows. There is a single variable $V$ for the neuron, its membrane potential (the potential difference between the inside and outside of the cell). In the absence of any input, the variable evolves over time according to the differential equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -V.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the constant $\\tau$ is the time constant of the neuron, and controls how quickly the neuron integrates its inputs. You can easily solve this differential equation to get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(t) = V(0) e^{-t/\\tau}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $V$ exponentially decays to the value 0, and the smaller $\\tau$ is the faster it does it. You can verify this with the interactive widget below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the neuron receives an incoming spike with synaptic weight $w$, the membrane potential instantly increases by $w$, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V\\leftarrow V+w.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interactive widget below, incoming spikes arrive at times $t_0$, $t_1$ and $t_2$, which you can change to see the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one of the incoming spikes causes $V$ to cross a *threshold* value, sometimes written as $V_t$, then the neuron will fire a spike, and instantaneously reset to the *reset* value $V_r$. In equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{If } V>V_t \\mbox{ then fire a spike and } V\\leftarrow V_r.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The net effect of all of this is that when $\\tau$ is large, the neuron acts as an *integrator*, summing its inputs and firing when they reach some threshold. If $\\tau$ is small, the neuron acts as a *coincidence detector*, firing a spike only if two or more inputs arrive simultaneously."

    "## Implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate this code, we do something like the following pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for each time period t:\n",
    "    Update V from value at time t to value at time t+dt\n",

    "        Emit a spike\n",
    "        Reset V\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this single neuron case, we don't need to handle propagating the output spike to other neurons because there are none, we just record that it happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the value of $V(t)$ to $V(t+\\mathrm{d}t)$ we use the equation from the section above to get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(t+\\mathrm{d}t)=V(t)e^{-\\mathrm{d}t/\\tau}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the quantity $\\alpha=e^{-\\mathrm{d}t/\\tau}$ doesn't depend on the time $t$ or the membrane potential $V$ so we can just calculate it once outside the loop and then just update $V(t+\\mathrm{d}t)=\\alpha V(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In subsequent notebooks, I'll use the \"Brian\" spiking neural network simulator, but I wanted to show how simple the basic simulation loop is."
